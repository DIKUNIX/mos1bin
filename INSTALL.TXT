Moscow SML requires a 386 or 486 PC with 2 MB of RAM or more, and DOS
3.3 or later.  The installation requires around 360 KB disk space.

INSTALLING MOSCOW SML UNDER DOS

Create two directories

    C:\mosml                for executable files
    C:\tmp                  for swap files

Copy the files 
    mosml.exe       camlrun.exe     emu387
from the diskette to C:\mosml

Add C:\mosml to the PATH variable, and set the GO32TMP variable.
That is, your AUTOEXEC.BAT file should contain something like:
    
    set PATH=C:\dos;  ...  ;C:\mosml
    set GO32TMP=C:\tmp
        
If your PC has no floating point processor, add also:
    
    set GO32=emu C:\mosml\emu387

Reboot the system.  Start Moscow SML by typing 
    mosml

To quit Moscow SML, type `quit();' or control-Z and return.
